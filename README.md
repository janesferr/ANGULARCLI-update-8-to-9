# Angular: Cloud-Powered Apps with Firebase

## Exercise files for LinkedIn Learning Course: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/angular-cloud-powered-apps-with-firebase/

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.0.

## Using the files

The `master` branch contains the completed application, and the starting point for this course will be the branch `01-04-begin`. I recommend you start here and work together with me and build the entire application. Once you download the exercise files, you will only need to `nom install` once at the root of this project.

At any point, if you wish to see the files for a specific video, there is a branch you can use.

For example, if you are in Chapter 2, video 3, you can checkout the branch

```
git checkout 02-03-begin
```

If you wish to see the completed files for that particular video you can check out the branch

```
git checkout 02-03-end
```

When switching branches, make sure to either stash your changes or commit them.

For each video, you can check out the pull request I made to verify the changes match with your work: https://github.com/victormejia/angular-cloud-powered-firebase-dashboard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed

Lastly, there is sample data that you can use for your users, including sample profile images.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.
